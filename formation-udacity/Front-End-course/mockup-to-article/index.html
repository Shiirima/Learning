    <h1>Humans vs. Machines: An AI Odyssey</h1>

  <p><em><strong>***Breaking News: AlphaGo has won the first two
  matches!***</strong> In this, the third in our series on the epic Go matches
  being played <br> between AlphaGo (Google’s Artificial Intelligence
  software) and Lee Se-Dol (Current Go World Champion), we look at the history
  of <br>Humans vs. Machines, and the innovations that have led us to this
  incredible moment in time.</em></p>

  <p>For as long as humans have built things, we’ve wrestled with the
  implications of what we’ve built. In many cases, these philosophical and
  <br>ethical wrestlings have made for great drama—think Frankenstein, or
  2001: A Space Odyssey. Often, the hypothetical scenarios we envision<br>
  come remarkably close to true, and the discoveries we’ve made in the fields
  of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning make clear that a<br>
  “computer with a mind of its own” is <s>going to take over the world</s>not
  such a fantastic thing to imagine any longer.<p>

  <h2>The Triumph Of Deep Blue</h2>

  <p>Perhaps this is why we are so captivated by human vs. machine
  competitions, because the idea of being overcome by that which we’ve<br>
  created speaks to something very deep within our collective consciousness.
  When IBM’s Deep Blue faced off against Garry Kasparov<sup>1</sup>, the<br>
  event resulted in more than <a
  href="http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/ibm100/us/en/icons/deepblue/">three
  billion impressions</a> around the world, and when IBM’s later creation
  Watson challenged the champions on<br> Jeopardy, millions of viewers were
  glued to the proceedings.</p>


  <h2>DeepMind’s AlphaGo</h2>

  <p>Taking place right now, there is an event that, while not likely to scale
  the same media heights, may in fact have far greater implications<br> when
  it comes to the future of “intelligent” machines. On March 9, in Seoul,
  South Korea, a computing system know as AlphoGo (built by <br>researchers at
  DeepMind—a Google Artificial Intelligence lab) began<a
  href="http://venturebeat.com/2016/02/04/youtube-will-livestream-googles-ai-
  playing-go-superstar-lee-sedol-in-march/"> a five-game match</a> against Lee
  Se-dol, one of the very best players in<br> the world at the ancient game of
  go.</p>
  
  <div> why is this so significant?</div>

  <p>here is how the deepmind team explained it in their paper <a
  href="http://airesearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/deepmind-mastering-
  go.pdf">mastering the game of go with deep neural networks and tree
  search</a></p>
  
  <p><em>the game of go has long been viewed as the most challenging of
  classic games for artificial intelligence due to its enormous search
  space<br> and the difficulty of evaluating board positions and
  moves.</em></p> <p>put another way, winning at go is a kind of holy grail
  for those who strive to create machines that can “think” on their own,
  because<br> success at this uniquely complex game seems to require something
  more than just skill, knowledge, and experience. it requires intuition.<br>
  feel. style. characteristics we associate with humans, not with
  machines.</p>
